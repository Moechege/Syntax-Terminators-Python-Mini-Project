 # MTN Ivory Coast Technology Infrastructure
This repository contains an analysis of the telecommunications company MTN in Ivory Coast and will be used to recommend how MTN telecommunication operations can be expanded. Various data cleaning and analysis techniques were used and recommendations were provided based on the results of the analysis.

# Project Description
The telecommunications industry is one of the fastest-growing sectors in the world, due to the increase in the adoption of digital services all over the world. Numerous factors affect the adoption of a service provider by consumers. Components such as cost of products offered, accessibility of products and the speed at which the services can be offered are some of these factors.

Cote dâ€™Ivoire has two competing companies offering fixed telecommunication services. The MTN Group and Orange network. As of mid-2017, MTN had a market share of 34% in the telecommunication field. With MTN being one of the strongest telecoms companies in Ivory Coast it is crucial that they sustain their profitability and adaptability rates by expanding their infrastructure across various cities in the country. This analysis was conducted to provide the best proposal on how MTN should upgrade their fracture.

The data sets in this analysis contain MTN product usage data consisting of MTN products, their billing price, and anonymized phone numbers for data privacy. This data set is a three-day sample extracted from a contemporary dataset. The geo data set consists of cities in Ivory Coast which will be merged with the other dataset to infer observations from the data

# Technologies Used
